### (`pthree` or $p^3$)

#### Utility scripts to assist in renaming and generating metadata files for digital photos.

I created this utility to suit my own personal digital photography workflow. It probably won't work for you. Feel free to fork and modify to suit your needs.

## Requirements

This script requires Python 3.9.

This script depends on both [`exiftool`](https://exiftool.org/) and [`typer`](https://typer.tiangolo.com/).

`exiftool` must be installed manually prior to using this script. Please follow the instructions [here](https://exiftool.org/install.html).

2. Navigate to the cloned repository 
```
cd [cloned repository directory]
```
3. Use pip to install the package locally

```
