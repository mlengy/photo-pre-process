#### Utility scripts to assist in renaming and generating metadata files for digital photos.

I created this utility to suit my own personal digital photography workflow. It probably won't work for you. Feel free to fork and modify to suit your needs.

## Requirements

This script requires Python 3.9.

This script depends on [`exiftool`](https://exiftool.org/), [`typer`](https://typer.tiangolo.com/), and [`rich`](https://github.com/Textualize/rich).

`exiftool` must be installed manually prior to using this script. Please follow the instructions [here](https://exiftool.org/install.html).

## Installation

This utility can only be installed from source.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the cloned repository.
```
cd [cloned repository directory]
```
3. Use pip to install the package locally.
```
pip install .
```

## Usage

Invoke by running `pthree`.

- `pthree rename` to batch rename photos using EXIF date and time data.
- `pthree texif` to automatically generate human readable text EXIF data in different formats according to presets.
- `pthree exif` to automatically generate binary EXIF sidecar files.
- `pthree process` as a shortcut to do all three above actions at the same time.
- `pthree info` to decode information from renamed filenames.
- `pthree yank` moves or copies files to a different location.
- `pthree list` lists files in the specified directory.
- `pthree film` to generate human readable metadata for [LensTagger](https://www.lenstagger.com/) tagged film pictures for Instagram.
    - The following EXIF tags are required to use the `film` command:
        - `Make`
        - `Model`
        - `Lens`
        - `UserComment`
    - `UserComment` must be automatically generated by LensTagger and must have two separate lines containing only text in the following format:
        - `Film Make: []` (e.g. `Film Make: Kodak`)
        - `Film Type: []` (e.g. `Film Type: Portra 400`)

For more information, run `pthree --help`.
